# Frontend Mentor - Bookmark landing page

![Design preview for the Bookmark landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

There's nice looking page named ''bookmark". It's fully responsive website for all devices with nice looking and nice JS functionalities like hamburger menu, revealing sections made with Intersection Observer and FAQ accordion. Design is from FRONT END MENTOR exercises with more functionalities than expected.
